# GameDesignFinal

This is a simple endless survival game made using openFrameworks and C++. The basis of the game is that you are a journalist who writes a critical story of Donald Trump and has to face the consequences. The player is controlled using WASD and the objective is to avoid the exploding bombs for as long as possible. The amount of bombs increases when the score reaches 2500 and 5000. The bombs have two states falling and exploding. When they are falling you can run underneath them and when they are exploding if you come in contact with them the game will end.
